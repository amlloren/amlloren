## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Adrienne Lloren, a data analyst with a knack for translating complex datasets into actionable insights. Having recently earned my Data Science Certificate from the University of Toronto, Iâ€™m eager to apply my skills to real-world challenges. I thrive in roles that let me combine analytical rigor with creativity, whether itâ€™s developing dashboards, designing slide decks, or simplifying technical insights for broader audiences.

One of my recent projects, the [Pharmaceutical Drug Spending Analysis](https://github.com/amlloren/Pharma-Spending-by-Countries), allowed me to explore decades of global spending data using Python and Tableau. This project highlights my technical expertise in data cleaning, regression, clustering, forecasting and data visualization as well as my commitment to delivering polished and impactful results. You can explore this project further by watching my summary video [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ASvZEvJ-3i7NKkFGaMeeubGUNcCa5nAl/view).
